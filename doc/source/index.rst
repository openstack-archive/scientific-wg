========================
Scientific Working Group
========================

Purpose
=======

The Scientific Working Group is dedicated to representing and
advancing the use-cases and needs of research and high-performance
computing atop OpenStack. It's also a great forum for cross-institutional
collaboration. If you are (or would like to) run OpenStack to support
researchers/scientists/academics and/or HPC/HTC, then please join!

Objectives
==========

* HPC/HTC Infrastructure
* Research Data Infrastructure
* Application Infrastructure
* Social Infrastructure
* Create opportunities for the scientific community to engage the wider OpenStack community, i.e. industry

Communication
=============

The default communication of our members is via the following open
community mailing lists:

* user-committee@lists.openstack.org for coordination of working
  group activities. Please prefix email subject lines with the tag
  "[scientific-wg]".

* openstack-operators@lists.openstack.org for operational discussion
  of scientific OpenStack deployment issues. Please prefix email
  subject lines with the tag "[scientific]".

Please use the hashtag "scientific-wg" for tagging any etherpad
URLs, code, blogs posts, scientific research and/or other social
publishing platforms.

The Working Group also maintains a `wiki page`_.

The Working Group has `weekly IRC meetings`_ in alternating time zones.

Members
=======

No formal membership is required. Please introduce yourself and/or
fellow colleagues to this working group using one of the mailing
lists below, or by attending one of the IRC meetings.

This group is open to all members of the scientific OpenStack
community and supporting vendors.

Documents

The Scientific Working Group maintains a guide to meeting the requirements of
scientific computing workloads on OpenStack, titled
*The Crossroads of Cloud and HPC: OpenStack for Scientific Research*.
